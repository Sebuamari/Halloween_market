## Project Overview

The Halloween Market Simulation is a Python program that creates an interactive model of a city with multiple costume shops. Customers visit shops to buy costumes, and the demand for specific items is tracked to reflect market conditions. Each time a customer purchases an item, the city adjusts demand based on available stock and customer choices.

## Features

- **City Class**: Manages the Halloween market as a whole, including costume shops and customer activity.
- **CostumeShop Class**: Represents individual shops with a unique inventory of costumes and items.
- **Customer Class**: Simulates customer interactions with shops, including purchasing items and influencing demand.
